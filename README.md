# 30 languages in 30 days
Inspired by [Genki Hagata][01] I'm going to write a bit of code in 30 different languages over a month's time. I'd like to explore a little about what makes each language unique, but at a bare minimum, and recognizing it's the middle of the semester, I'm going to get a Hello, World up for each.

- [Day 01 C] [02]
- [Day 02 C++][03]
- [Day 03 Pascal][04]
- [Day 04 Lisp][05]
- [Day 05 Rust][06]
- [Day 06 Go][07]
- [Day 07 FORTRAN][08]
- [Day 08 Haskell][09]
