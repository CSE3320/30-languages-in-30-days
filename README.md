# 30 languages in 30 days
Inspired by [Genki Hagata][01] I'm going to write a bit of code in 30 different languages over a month's time. I'd like to explore a little about what makes each language unique, but at a bare minimum, and recognizing it's the middle of the semester, I'm going to get a Hello, World up for each.

- Day 01 [hello.c][02]: C
- Day 02 [hello.cxx][03]: C++
- Day 03 [hello.pas][04]: Pascal 
- Day 04 [hello.lsp][05]: Lisp 
- Day 05 [hello.rs][06]: Rust 
- Day 06 [hello.go][07]: Go 
- Day 07 [hello.f][08]: FORTRAN 
- Day 08 [hello.hs][09]: Haskell
