# 30 languages in 30 days
Inspired by [Genki Hagata][01] I'm going to write a bit of code in 30 different languages over a month's time. I'd like to explore a little about what makes each language unique, but at a bare minimum, and recognizing it's the middle of the semester, I'm going to get a Hello, World up for each.
